        Main function, which gets called during step() of the environment.

        Observation space:
            game_map: whole grid of board_size, which already has applied visibility mask on it
            allied_ships: an array of all currently available ships for the player. The ships are represented as a list:
                (ship id, position x, y, current health points, firing_cooldown, move_cooldown)

            enemy_ships: same, but for the opposing player ships
            planets_occupation: for each visible planet, it shows the occupation progress:
                - planet_x: int [0, 100]
                - planet_y: int [0, 100]

                    Values between indicate an ongoing conflict for the ownership of the planet
            resources: current resources available for building

        Action space:
            ships_actions: player can provide an action to be executed by every of his ships.

                - speed (not applicable when firing): int [0, 3] - a number of fields to move
            construction: int [0, 10] - a number of ships to be constructed
